If you want to test it simply run Kalaha_GUI.py

Button Start: Will create the field with the specified values
Button Auto Move: Uses the AI to find a good move and applies it

Field Buttons: Clicking a field button will take it's marbles and distribute them according to the rules

The last clicked Button will appear green (for human and AI)
Edit: On Rule is still missing (if you end up in a goal field you should be allowed to go again. I'll add that later)
